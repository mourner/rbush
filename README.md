RBush
=====

RBush is a high-performance JavaScript library for 2D **spatial indexing** of points and rectangles.
It's based on an optimized **R-tree** data structure with **bulk insertion** support.

*Spatial index* is a special data structure for points and rectangles
that allows you to perform queries like "all items within this bounding box" very efficiently
(e.g. hundreds of times faster than looping over all items).
It's most commonly used in maps and data visualizations.

## Demos

The demos contain visualization of trees generated from 50k bulk-loaded random points.
Open web console to see benchmarks;
click on buttons to insert or remove items;
click to perform search under the cursor.

## Install

Install with NPM (`npm install rbush`), or use CDN links for browsers:
[rbush.js](https://npmcdn.com/rbush@2.0.1/rbush.js),
[rbush.min.js](https://npmcdn.com/rbush@2.0.1/rbush.min.js)

## Usage

### Creating a Tree

```js
var tree = rbush(9);
```

An optional argument to `rbush` defines the maximum number of entries in a tree node.
It drastically affects the performance, so you should adjust it
considering the type of data and search queries you perform.

### Adding Data

Insert an item:

```js
var item = {
    minX: 20,
    minY: 40,
    maxX: 30,
    maxY: 50,
    foo: 'bar'
};
tree.insert(item);
```

### Removing Data

Remove a previously inserted item:

```js
tree.remove(item);
```

By default, RBush removes objects by reference.
However, you can pass a custom `equals` function to compare by value for removal,
which is useful when you only have a copy of the object you need removed (e.g. loaded from server):

```js
tree.remove(itemCopy, function (a, b) {
    return a.id === b.id;
});
```

Remove all items:

```js
tree.clear();
```

### Data Format

By default, RBush assumes the format of data points to be an object
with `minX`, `minY`, `maxX` and `maxY` properties.
You can customize this by providing an array with corresponding accessor strings
as a second argument to `rbush` like this:

```js
var tree = rbush(9, ['[0]', '[1]', '[0]', '[1]']); // accept [x, y] points
tree.insert([20, 50]);
```

### Bulk-Inserting Data

Bulk-insert the given data into the tree:

```js
tree.load([item1, item2, ...]);
```

Bulk insertion is usually ~2-3 times faster than inserting items one by one.
After bulk loading (bulk insertion into an empty tree),
subsequent query performance is also ~20-30% better.

Note that when you do bulk insertion into an existing tree,
it bulk-loads the given data into a separate tree
and inserts the smaller tree into the larger tree.
This means that bulk insertion works very well for clustered data
(where items in one update are close to each other),
but makes query performance worse if the data is scattered.

### Search

```js
var result = tree.search({
    minX: 40,
    minY: 20,
    maxX: 80,
    maxY: 70
});
```

Returns an array of data items (points or rectangles) that the given bounding box intersects.

Note that the `search` method accepts a bounding box in `{minX, minY, maxX, maxY}` format
regardless of the format specified in the constructor (which only affects inserted objects).

```js
var allItems = tree.all();
```

Returns all items of the tree.

### Collisions

```js
var result = tree.collides({minX: 40, minY: 20, maxX: 80, maxY: 70});
```

Returns `true` if there are any items intersecting the given bounding box, otherwise `false`.


### Export and Import

```js
// export data as JSON object
var treeData = tree.toJSON();

// import previously exported data
var tree = rbush(9).fromJSON(treeData);
```

Importing and exporting as JSON allows you to use RBush on both the server (using Node.js) and the browser combined,
e.g. first indexing the data on the server and and then importing the resulting tree data on the client for searching.

Note that the `nodeSize` option passed to the constructor must be the same in both trees for export/import to work properly.

### K-Nearest Neighbors

## Performance

The following sample performance test was done by generating
random uniformly distributed rectangles of ~0.01% area and setting `maxEntries` to `16`
(see `debug/perf.js` script).
Performed with Node.js v6.2.2 on a Retina Macbook Pro 15 (mid-2012).

Test                         | RBush  | [old RTree](https://github.com/imbcmdth/RTree) | Improvement
---------------------------- | ------ | ------ | ----
insert 1M items one by one   | 3.18s  | 7.83s  | 2.5x
1000 searches of 0.01% area  | 0.03s  | 0.93s  | 30x
1000 searches of 1% area     | 0.35s  | 2.27s  | 6.5x
1000 searches of 10% area    | 2.18s  | 9.53s  | 4.4x
remove 1000 items one by one | 0.02s  | 1.18s  | 50x
bulk-insert 1M items         | 1.25s  | n/a    | 6.7x

## Algorithms Used

* single insertion: non-recursive R-tree insertion with overlap minimizing split routine from R\*-tree (split is very effective in JS, while other R\*-tree modifications like reinsertion on overflow and overlap minimizing subtree search are too slow and not worth it)
* single deletion: non-recursive R-tree deletion using depth-first tree traversal with free-at-empty strategy (entries in underflowed nodes are not reinserted, instead underflowed nodes are kept in the tree and deleted only when empty, which is a good compromise of query vs removal performance)
* bulk loading: OMT algorithm (Overlap Minimizing Top-down Bulk Loading) combined with Floyd–Rivest selection algorithm
* bulk insertion: STLT algorithm (Small-Tree-Large-Tree)
* search: standard non-recursive R-tree search

## Development

```bash
npm install  # install dependencies

npm run perf # run performance benchmarks
npm run cov  # report test coverage (with more detailed report in coverage/lcov-report/index.html)

## Compatibility

RBush should run on Node and all major browsers. The only caveat: IE 8 needs an [Array#indexOf polyfill](https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/indexOf#Polyfill) for `remove` method to work.
